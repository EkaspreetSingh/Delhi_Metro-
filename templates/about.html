            <p class="card-text mb-auto" style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The Delhi Metro has been instrumental in ushering in a new era in the sphere of mass urban transportation in Delhi NCR. The swanky and modern Metro system introduced comfortable, air conditioned and eco-friendly services for the first time in India and completely revolutionized the mass transportation scenario not only in the National Capital Region but the entire country. Having constructed a massive network of about 390.14 Km with 286 stations (including NOIDA-Greater NOIDA Corridor and Rapid Metro, Gurugram) in record time in Delhi, NCR, the DMRC today stands out as a shining example of how a mammoth technically complex infrastructure project can be completed before time and within budgeted cost by a Government agency. The Delhi Metro network consists of about 390.14 Km with 286 stations. The network has now crossed the boundaries of Delhi to reach NOIDA and Ghaziabad in Uttar Pradesh, Gurgaon, Faridabad, Bahadurgarh and Ballabhgarh in Haryana.

            <p class="card-text mb-auto" style="text-justify: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The Delhi Metro project was first proposed in the 1980s, but construction did not begin until 1998. The first section of the metro, between Tis Hazari and Shahdara, opened in 2002. The network has since expanded rapidly, with new lines and extensions being added regularly. The DMRC has been credited with reducing traffic congestion in Delhi and improving air quality, as well as promoting economic development and urban renewal in the city. The organization has also been recognized for its efficient management and innovative use of technology. It is a state-owned company with equal equity participation from Government of India and Government of National Capital Territory of Delhi. The DMRC has also expanded its reach to other parts of the National Capital Region (NCR) including Ghaziabad, Faridabad, Gurgaon and Noida and Ballabhgarh. The DMRC is also working on the expansion of the metro network in various other cities in India.</font></font></p>

          <p class="card-text mb-auto" style="text-justify: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The Delhi Metro has had a significant impact on the environment since it began operations. One of the main benefits of the metro is that it has helped to reduce air pollution and traffic congestion in the city. The metro carries millions of passengers daily, which has led to a reduction in the number of cars and buses on the roads, thereby reducing emissions and improving air quality. The metro system is powered by electricity, which is generated from renewable sources like hydroelectric, solar and wind power. This has reduced the dependence on fossil fuels and reduced the emission of greenhouse gases. The construction of the metro also had an impact on the environment. During the construction of the metro, the DMRC took measures to minimize the impact on the surrounding ecosystem such as preserving green areas, avoiding the cutting of trees, relocating the animals and preserving the heritage sites. The DMRC has also been recognized for its efforts to promote sustainable practices and reduce its environmental impact. The metro has been certified as a "Green Metro" by the Indian Green Building Council for its efforts to reduce energy consumption, minimize waste and promote recycling.</font></font></p>
